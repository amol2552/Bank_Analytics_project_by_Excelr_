Bank Analytics Project

Introducion:- 
This project involved analyzing Customer bank loan data. We were given two .csv files, each containing 39,000 rows, with the goal of assessing 
the bank's growth in loans over the specified years. To achieve this, we used MS Excel and MySQL for data analysis, cleaning, and removing duplicates. 
We then created interactive dashboards using Tableau and Power BI, performing calculations and merging data to visualize the results effectively.


KPI's:- 
1] Year Wise Loan Amount Status.

2] Grade And Sub Grade wise Revolutionary balence.

3] Total_Payment For Verified And Not Verified status .

4] State and Month wise Loan status .

5] Home_Ownership vs Last payment Date_status.


Steps Performs On dataset for cleaning:- 

In preparing our dataset for analysis, we undertook a series of cleaning and transformation steps before processing the data. 
The initial and critical step was to data model the two datasets, which was followed by thorough data cleaning to ensure 
the accuracy and relevance of the information. 
Hereâ€™s an overview of the key actions taken:- 

Data Modelling:- Formed a one to one relationship between Finance_1 and Finance_2 using the common ID column.
Handling Missing Values:- Identified and addressed missing data to avoid bias.
Removing Duplicate or Irrelevant Columns:- Eliminated duplicate columns to avoid redundancy and 
removed those that did not add value to the analysis or fell outside the project scope. 
Ensuring Data Consistency:- Standardized data formats and units across the dataset.
